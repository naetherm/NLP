### [Language Detection](language_detection)

All models were trained and evaluation on the [Tatoeba dataset](http://downloads.tatoeba.org/exports/sentences.tar.bz2).

There are the following implementations:

 * Baseline implementation using the python langdetect module (00_langdetect.py)
 * Character N-Gram implementation (01_nsec_langdetect.py)
 
 
 ### [POS Tagging](pos_tagging)
 
 All models were trained and evaluated on [CONLL POS](https://cogcomp.org/page/resource_view/81) dataset.
 
 There are the following implementations:
 
  * Basic BERT language model approach (10_bert.py)
  
 
 ### [Entity Tagging](entity_tagging)
 
 All models were trained and evaluated on [CONLL POS](https://cogcomp.org/page/resource_view/81) dataset.
 
 There are the following implementations:
 
  * Basic BERT language model approach (10_bert.py)
